## Choice of license
Our license of predilection is AGPL v3 or later.
See https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/

If a software needs to link with proprietary software, we use LGPL v3 or later.
See https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/

## How to apply AGPL v3 or later

Mandatory steps:

- Create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of your source code and copy the text of the license into the file.

Optional steps:

- The Free Software Foundation recommends taking the additional step of adding a boilerplate notice to the top of each file. The boilerplate can be found at the end of the license.
- Add `AGPL-3.0-or-later` to your project's package description, if applicable (e.g., Node.js, Ruby, and Rust). This will ensure the license is displayed in package directories.

## Boilerplate for AGPL v3 or later
This header can be put in a comment at the top of every source file in a project.
Replace the first line by a description of the project, or remove it.
