# Versioning
For the version numbers, we follow Semantic Versioning 2.0

https://semver.org/

In a summary:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

For example, you might start your development at version 0.1.0, or 1.0.0, and then increment the right number for each next version number you create.
Don't forget to create a Git tag.
